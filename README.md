# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This project demonstrated that I can build a sample website as part of bootcamp prework. My motivation was to complete the bootcamp prework via a Github Pages website deployment. This solves the issue of me not yet knowing how to deploy a Github pages website using CSS, HTML, JS, and Git. I have learned how to deploy a sample website on Github Pages via this project.
